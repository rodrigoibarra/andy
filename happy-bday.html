		<p>The time difference is a bitch! But i'm pretty sure that when you see this, it will still be your birthday!!</p>

		<p>Anyway, I wanted to make something special, something just for you and something that you could see and enjoy even when you are on the other side of the planet. So I made this, it's small and made out of absolutely nothing, but it's coded with lots of love just for you so...</p>

		<h2 class="hbd">Happy Birthday Andy!</h2>
