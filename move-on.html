    <p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about time lately, about how much time I spent in school or how much time I&#8217;ve been working on the industry and I sat and as usual when I think and reflect on my life, you seem to pop all over the place, I noticed I&#8217;ve spent 46% of my life with you and 33.33% of that time trying to move on from ever being in love with you.</p>

    <p>Moving on is hard, heck, writing about moving on seems to be harder&#8230; I&#8217;m still trying to learn how to live without you but your constant presence in my life makes it hard, both living and moving on. True, it is also my fault, maybe I never wanted, maybe I still had hope but this story, is not about me, it&#8217;s not even about you&#8230; It&#8217;s about her.</p>

    <p>This short story is about someone else, someone different, someone new&#8230; something new. I&#8217;m not even sure how it got started, but I&#8217;m glad it did, all I remember was that at first it was a game, simple and maybe not so innocent but a game non the less and playing led to talking and going down a path I hadn&#8217;t been in years&#8230; A path that came with butterflies and headaches and most of all heartaches.
    This girl, this amazing girl, who I knew was not a rebound like the others before her for the sole fact that I&#8217;ve never compared her to you, alas, I may have found a perfect match, fun to talk to, intelligent, beautiful and kinda weird and awkward and goofy and cute, god she is cute. Even the Facebook push notification when she writes me is cute, it aches when we fight, it is difficult, nay, impossible not talking to her, I&#8217;ve even come to trust her and talk with her about my feelings and problems&#8230; But in all her glory, all her wonders, this girl, this girl was not ready, she is on the process of moving on and moving on is hard. Not knowing if you want to, is hard, not knowing if you want to ripoff all your feelings from your heart and burn them in a pile of memories, it&#8217;s hard and it takes time. </p>

    <p>And I think about my own moving on, my own process, and it wasn&#8217;t easy, it was hard and painful and at some times it was humiliating, I think about you and me and how much we hurt each other and how hard it was to trust in the end, how we treated each other and I don&#8217;t want that. I&#8217;m afraid I would make the same mistakes and hurt her like that and it freaks me out.
    And I realize I&#8217;m already a step ahead of not doing it, I&#8217;m already thinking about how I wil not hurt her and picture us just chilling eating popcorn and watching the basterds. And it feels right. I realize I can do this, I wan to do this and if I fuck up or we fuck up, I have to be there to fix those mistakes, I realize that this relationship that hasn&#8217;t started, that lives on a digital hypothesis with hopes of it working out, has to be something new. We will create our own thing. And it wonâ€™t be modeled on anything that came before.</p>

    <p>So I forgive you, I&#8217;ve moved on and hope she&#8217;d do the same and walk down the road with me, ride off into the sunset and figure out the rest of the story&#8230;</p>

    <p>B.</p>
